# pqrng
Psuedo Quantum Random Number Generator (PQRNG) built by python and Google CirQ.
This is a Psuedo Quantum Random Number Generator (PQRNG) based on LFSR+XOR algorithm. It builds a quantum circuit in Google CirQ that implements the PQRNG over n qbits.
The code acts both as a quantum circuit builder and as a hybrid (classical+quantum) processing pipeline.
